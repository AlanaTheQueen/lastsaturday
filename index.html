      <h3> Here is a list of fruits that grow in winter </h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b> Calementine: </b> A clementine looks a lot like an orange. That is because it is in a way. It is actually a mixture between a mandarin orange and a sweet orange. </li>
        <li><b> Date plums: </b> Date plums are small like a plum but are yellow in color. They have no cholesterol but a ton of fiber. This fruit also packs a ton of Vitamin A and C. </li>
        <li><b> Dates: </b> Dates are a tiny fruit with a bunch of benefits. It is a fruit that is high in many vitamins and minerals. They contain a lot of calcium and iron which is great for those that are facing anemia or have brittle bones. </li>
        <li><b> Grapefruit: </b> Grapefruit is another fruit that often produces in warmer climates over the winter months. This fruit is great as a juice or eaten by itself. I personally love to add a little sweetener or honey to it and eat the inner part of the fruit. </li>
        <li><b> Kiwi fruit: </b> The kiwi fruit is a delicious yet, funny fruit. The reason I say it is funny is that it has this fuzzy outer shell that it must be peeled out of. </li>
        <li><b> Mandarin orange: </b> Mandarin oranges are a favorite around my house. They are sweet little oranges that are very tender in comparison with other orange varieties. </li>
        <li><b> Papaya: </b> Papayas are interesting winter fruits that have been enjoyed for many, many years. Once considered a rather exotic fruit, it can now be found in the supermarkets practically year round. </li>
        <li><b> Orange: </b> Who doesn’t love a good orange? Especially during cold and flu season. Most of us know that oranges are great for Vitamin C, but did you know that oranges contain phytochemicals that help protect against cancer and fight kidney disease? </li>
        <li><b> Passion fruit: </b> Passion fruit is a unique-looking fruit that has a solid outside and a gelatin looking inside. Though it may be unique in appearance, that isn’t the only unique thing about it. </li>
        <li><b> Pear: </b> My husband and children love pears. I love them because they are something my picky children will eat that is very good for them. </li>
        <li><b> Persimmons: </b> Did you know that persimmons actually have two names? They are called a persimmon and a Sharon fruit. So if you see either of those names, now you’ll know that they are one in the same. </li>
        <li><b> Pomegranate: </b> Pomegranates are one of the super foods. This means that it gives your body a lot of different nutrients that protects it against a lot of different things. </li>
        <li><b> Red banana: </b> Red bananas are not as common in my area of the world but some may see them on a regular basis. This fruit is most commonly grown in Costa Rica. They are usually favored in Mexico, Australia, and Central America. </li>
        <li><b> Tangerines: </b> Tangerines are another citrus fruit that is often available in warmer climates during the winter months. To me, it is basically a smaller (and often sweeter) version of an orange. </li>
        <li><b> Apple: </b> Apples often flood the super markets during the winter months. Again, it is because of warm weather producers. </li>
        <li><b> Kumquats: </b> Kumquats are another small citrus fruit that are common to come from warm weather producers during the winter months. They are smaller and resemble an orange and a pear in one. </li>
        <li><b> Star fruit: </b> A star fruit is one that is less commonly known in some parts of the world, but you might want to become familiar with it after knowing a little more about it. The fruit is called a star fruit because it does slightly resemble a star in its shape. </li>
        <li><b> Quinces: </b> The quince is a fruit that is ancient but also known for being difficult. It is usually pretty hard to find but if you do, you’ll need to not let it go. </li>
        <li><b> Rambutans: </b> Rambutans are a tropical fruit that look kind of crazy. They have red wild hair on the outside and a white inside. </li>   
      </ul>
